As a Consulting Engineer for F5 Networks I get to work on a lot of different projects, with a full spectrum of companies in the Americas, all the while backed up by incredible f5 staff comprised of my peers, project managers, sales engineers, support engineers, and product development engineers.  As a former customer of F5, I've had the experience of being on both sides of the consulting engagement and I keep the thoughts that I had as a client in mind as I engage my clients as an F5 Consulting Engineer.  I can only have a successful engagement when my client is successful and I will do whatever it professionally takes for all of us to be successful; working nights, weekends, being on site, is never an issue - I draw the line at waxing cars in the parking lot.  In addition to having engagments that go from a plan to a successful deployment and the exposure to new technologies that accomanpany the transition, the enrichment of interacting with a diverse range of individuals that bring into the process a wide breadth of ideas and processes is wonderfully enriching.  And, it's not just F5 technologies such as AFM, APM, ASM, GTM, and LTM but all the supporting and interacting technologies necessary to make an enterprise successful.  For the consummate network engineer such as myself, this is the place to be, drinking from the fire hydrant of F5 knowledge and exchanging thoughts with highly talented peers in the industry.

My work is focused on internal facing data science projects. I am building out the company’s first predictive models for both Customer Churn and Lead Scoring. I have a strong familiarity with end to end data engineering, machine learning algorithms such as random forests, logistic regression, and survival modeling techniques. My ability to take on projects never tried before at the company is helped by the pairing of my data science domain with my ability to comprehend the business domain surrounding the data science targeted solutions.

STR-SpeechTech specializes in text-to-speech software used in the aviation industry, producing high-quality automated voice broadcasts in a safety-critical domain.My primary role there was in production: maintaining the text-to-speech rules, keeping up with industry data standards, configuring the product per client specifications, and ensuring that the audio output was of very high quality.My secondary role was on the research team, whose goal it was to produce the highest quality unlimited text-to-speech system available. This is where I discovered my passion for Natural Language Processing. I wrote Python scripts to identify audio files that would be appropriate to use to create new audio data, based on the phonetic proximity to the target data. I performed an investigation into how much additional audio data was necessary in order to have sufficient data to produce unlimited text to speech, by comparing triphone sequences in the Brown corpus to those in the STR corpus. I created a part-of-speech tagger for the aviation data by training an ngram tagger on news data from the Brown corpus, then used a Brill tagger to improve the results. I experimented with several grammars from NLTK in an attempt to determine prosody for the output data.

Setu is a FinTech start-up that works with financial institutions to makes formal finance more accessible to India’s underbanked population using application programming interfaces. I worked extensively on Open Banking and on the interface of banking and financial inclusion. I performed comprehensive assessments of the commercial and legal feasibility of venturing into the Neobank and Small Finance Bank markets. Further, I worked on the digital taxation of cashless transactions in India, drafted software licensing and service level agreements and researched on several financial sector regulations including the Payment and Settlement Systems Act and the RBI Outsourcing Guidelines. I also represented Setu at round-table discussions on financial sector regulation at the NASSCOM start-up warehouse. Through this, I interacted with numerous stakeholders in the ecosystem and gained insight into their business and regulatory challenges. Finally, I had expressed an interest in data analytics work and was fortunate to work with the business development and data science teams on a project on RBI financial data. I filtered through massive volumes of payment/transaction data and produced analytics dashboards which were well appreciated by the team. I used this to contribute to an extensive report on the costs incurred by commercial banks and the commercial viability of increased adoption of digital and open banking channels.The internship provided me with a fresh perspective on banking, as distinct from my experience at commercial law firms, and has left me confident to tackle the challenges of the future of banking.

I worked on a wide range of TMT areas including data protection, cyber security, intermediary liability, data scraping, e-commerce and e-gaming. I also worked extensively on projects on insurance law, intellectual property law, arbitration law, employment law and biodiversity law (and its corresponding corporate obligations). The majority of my work stemmed from concerned international clients, prejudicially impacted by protectionist Indian technology laws. Examples include the abolition of safe harbour protection for internet intermediaries and the imposition of physical localisation and incorporation requirements on e-commerce entities transacting with Indians. Thus, my job was often two-fold. First, to challenge the legal and practical justifiability of the laws. Second, to determine and manage risks and provide viable solutions to clients. My prior commercial law and policy experience enabled me to deliberate ‘legal’ tasks through numerous diverse perspectives, i.e. policy-focused, legislative and commercial. This allowed me to provide comprehensive objections to the laws and innovative solutions to clients.
