I worked extensively on Open Banking and on the interface of banking and financial inclusion. I performed comprehensive assessments of the commercial and legal feasibility of venturing into the Neobank and Small Finance Bank markets. Further, I worked on the digital taxation of cashless transactions in India, drafted software licensing and service level agreements and researched on several financial sector regulations including the Payment and Settlement Systems Act and the RBI Outsourcing Guidelines. I also represented Setu at round-table discussions on financial sector regulation at the NASSCOM start-up warehouse. Through this, I interacted with numerous stakeholders in the ecosystem and gained insight into their business and regulatory challenges. Finally, I had expressed an interest in data analytics work and was fortunate to work with the business development and data science teams on a project on RBI financial data. I filtered through massive volumes of payment/transaction data and produced analytics dashboards which were well appreciated by the team. I used this to contribute to an extensive report on the costs incurred by commercial banks and the commercial viability of increased adoption of digital and open banking channels.The internship provided me with a fresh perspective on banking, as distinct from my experience at commercial law firms, and has left me confident to tackle the challenges of the future of banking.\n…\n        see more', "Visiting Editor\nCompany Name\nUniversity of Bologna Law Review\nDates Employed\nDec 2018 – Oct 2019\nEmployment Duration\n11 mos\nLocation\nBologna, Italy\nThe University of Bologna, founded in 1088, is the oldest University in Europe.

Examples include the abolition of safe harbour protection for internet intermediaries and the imposition of physical localisation and incorporation requirements on e-commerce entities transacting with Indians. Thus, my job was often two-fold. First, to challenge the legal and practical justifiability of the laws. Second, to determine and manage risks and provide viable solutions to clients.

I worked extensively on Open Banking and on the interface of banking and financial inclusion. I performed comprehensive assessments of the commercial and legal feasibility of venturing into the Neobank and Small Finance Bank markets. Further, I worked on the digital taxation of cashless transactions in India, drafted software licensing and service level agreements and researched on several financial sector regulations including the Payment and Settlement Systems Act and the RBI Outsourcing Guidelines. I also represented Setu at round-table discussions on financial sector regulation at the NASSCOM start-up warehouse. Through this, I interacted with numerous stakeholders in the ecosystem and gained insight into their business and regulatory challenges. Finally, I had expressed an interest in data analytics work and was fortunate to work with the business development and data science teams on a project on RBI financial data. I filtered through massive volumes of payment/transaction data and produced analytics dashboards which were well appreciated by the team. I used this to contribute to an extensive report on the costs incurred by commercial banks and the commercial viability of increased adoption of digital and open banking channels.The internship provided me with a fresh perspective on banking, as distinct from my experience at commercial law firms, and has left me confident to tackle the challenges of the future of banking.\n…\n        see more', "Visiting Editor\nCompany Name\nUniversity of Bologna Law Review\nDates Employed\nDec 2018 – Oct 2019\nEmployment Duration\n11 mos\nLocation\nBologna, Italy\nThe University of Bologna, founded in 1088, is the oldest University in Europe.

I also worked extensively on projects on insurance law, intellectual property law, arbitration law, employment law and biodiversity law (and its corresponding corporate obligations). The majority of my work stemmed from concerned international clients, prejudicially impacted by protectionist Indian technology laws. Examples include the abolition of safe harbour protection for internet intermediaries and the imposition of physical localisation and incorporation requirements on e-commerce entities transacting with Indians. Thus, my job was often two-fold. First, to challenge the legal and practical justifiability of the laws. Second, to determine and manage risks and provide viable solutions to clients. My prior commercial law and policy experience enabled me to deliberate ‘legal’ tasks through numerous diverse perspectives, i.e. policy-focused, legislative and commercial. This allowed me to provide comprehensive objections to the laws and innovative solutions to clients.\n…\n        see more', 'Successful Negotiation: Essential Strategies and Skills\nIssuing authority\nCoursera\nIssued date and, if applicable, expiration date of the certification or license\nIssued Nov 2019No Expiration Date\nCredential Identifier\nCredential ID XV9M8XTLEEMG\n          See credential', 'KPMG Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship\nIssuing authority\nInsideSherpa\nIssued date and, if applicable, expiration date of the certification or license\nIssued Oct 2019No Expiration Date\n          See credential', 'Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)\nIssuing authority\nCoursera\nIssued date and, if applicable, expiration date of the certification or license\nIssued Oct 2019No Expiration Date\nCredential Identifier\nCredential ID 5E9CVGTLVPH9\n          See credential', 'Baker McKenzie\n227,352 followers', 'Linklaters\n109,023 followers', 'CAE\n161,962 followers', 'Harvard Law School\n118,768 followers', 'Robert Half\n1,140,570 followers', '                    Careers']
